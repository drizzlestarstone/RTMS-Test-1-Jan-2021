RTMS Test 1 January 2021

Question can be found in the Whatsapp Image

Challenge for this test lies in

1. Multiplexing the 4 seven-segments
2. Having MSB and the 3-digit number to change in sync

Logic workflow in my head went a little bit like this:

TASK1
1. First, figure out how to count from 0-100 on the 7-segment.
2. Second, see if you can make it continuously loop

TASK2
1. First, figure out the hexadecimal numbers for each bit on the MSB 7-segment
2. Make it rotate.
3. Make it continuously loop

Next, make them change in sync. This would be the trippiest part, I should think.

Finally, get keypad inputs so that you can adjust the speed of change.

Most importantly - 
Do. Not. Panic.
